Techinc, Amsterdam Hackspace.
Android Notification App.

The space broadcasts its current status in terms of open and closed.
When this status changes, the notification app will place a notification on the Android status bar.


The compiled binary is available under the /bin directory as:
Techinc-Notify.apk

Download this and install it on your device.


Basic usage:
The initial page shows the settings for the app.  How often it polls, what sound to notify etc.

There are four buttons on this page:

Start   Starts the notification service.  The service will continue to run until it is stopped.
Stop    Stops the notification service.

Reset   Resets all you settings back to default.
Apply   Applies any changes to your settings.


Known issues:

The vibrate is not yet implemented.
Doesn't always stop when requested to do so.
(The service is run using Android Alarms, each poll is scheduled to start the service automatically after the last poll.
The stop button de-schedules the Alarm, however it appears there is a concurrency issue, in that the service will re-schedule itself
if it is currently running when requested to stop.)
